Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.

train.csv
building_id - Foreign key for the building metadata.
meter - The meter id code. Read as {0: electricity, 1: chilledwater, 2: steam, 3: hotwater}. Not every building has all meter types.
timestamp - When the measurement was taken
meter_reading - The target variable. Energy consumption in kWh (or equivalent). Note that this is real data with measurement error, which we expect will impose a baseline level of modeling error. 
                UPDATE: as discussed here, the site 0 electric meter readings are in kBTU.

building_meta.csv
site_id - Foreign key for the weather files.
building_id - Foreign key for training.csv
primary_use - Indicator of the primary category of activities for the building based on EnergyStar property type definitions
square_feet - Gross floor area of the building
year_built - Year building was opened
floor_count - Number of floors of the building

weather_[train/test].csv
Weather data from a meteorological station as close as possible to the site.

site_id
air_temperature - Degrees Celsius
cloud_coverage - Portion of the sky covered in clouds, in oktas
dew_temperature - Degrees Celsius
precip_depth_1_hr - Millimeters
sea_level_pressure - Millibar/hectopascals
wind_direction - Compass direction (0-360)
wind_speed - Meters per second
test.csv
The submission files use row numbers for ID codes in order to save space on the file uploads. test.csv has no feature data; it exists so you can get your predictions into the correct order.

row_id - Row id for your submission file
building_id - Building id code
meter - The meter id code
timestamp - Timestamps for the test data period
sample_submission.csv
A valid sample submission.

All floats in the solution file were truncated to four decimal places; we recommend you do the same to save space on your file upload.
There are gaps in some of the meter readings for both the train and test sets. Gaps in the test set are not revealed or scored.
