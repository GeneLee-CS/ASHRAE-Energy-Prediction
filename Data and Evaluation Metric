Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error.

The RMSLE is calculated as

ϵ=1n∑i=1n(log(pi+1)−log(ai+1))2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
Where:

ϵ is the RMSLE value (score)
n is the total number of observations in the (public/private) data set,
pi is your prediction of target, and
ai is the actual target for i.
log(x) is the natural logarithm of x
